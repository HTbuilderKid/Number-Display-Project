8. No, only the first call resulted in a change in the stored value (from 6 to 3), while the second one did not. As we talked about in class, the code in written with specific parameters. If the entered value is outside of the range, the value will not change (which prevents us from entering huge value or nagative ones).

9. If we set the value of the newly created 'digit' object to 10, which is it's rollover limit, it will simply go back to 0. 

11. Well, I'm working on my project at home, and my PC's language is set to Chinese, so the error message is a bunch of shenanigans. What I do know is that we are simply supposed to put a number between the parenthesis, and since int is a keyword, it's considered an error. All we have to do is just remove the int. 

12. Now that the <= has been added, the problem encountered in the second part of problem 9 will no longer occur. This is simply because of the =. Before, the value could only be changed if it's smaller than the limit (which didn't include the limit). However, now that we've added the =, it includes it.

18. No, it does not work under any circumstances. For instance, I've tried to set the value to 100, but when I called the getDisplayValue method, the return was "00", which is a two digit String.
